# Timeline of Anime 

## Description
- Side project by a lifelong Japanese anime fan ðŸ’–. Interactive and (hopefully) fun visualisation that allows you to explore anime over the decades. What kind of genres were popular when, what blend of genres makes for a good anime? Which are the most popular animes and how has the notion of popularity changed over time?
- React app; Visualisation in D3.js
